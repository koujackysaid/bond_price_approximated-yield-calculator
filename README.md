# bond_price_approximated-yield-calculator
- a calculator generate bond price and approximated bond yield, with explanations
- Shows the impact on the bond yield and bond price when market price changes, or when market interests rate change
- Shows that high yield is not necessarily means a good bond investment. The value of bonds is a comparable concept, most often, it is comparing the IRR of the bond investment(bond yield) with the market risk-free rate
### Further Question to follow:
- since this calculator assumes the market intersts rate remains constant during the bond life, while in reality, it will change. How to fit this situation in our estimation of the bond price and bond yield?
- this calculator only cals the price and yield of an individual bond. What if I am holding a portfolio containing bonds with multiple matiurities and different issuing dates? How to calculate the value of the entire portfolio? And how to show the VaR and tail risks of the portfolio?
